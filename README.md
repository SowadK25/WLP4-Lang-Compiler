# WLP4-Lang-Compiler
WLP4 is a programming lanuage that is a subset of C++. This compiler will compile ```.wlp4``` files and generate assembly ```.asm``` files. From there, an appropriate linker can be used on the Linux environment to generate machine code and execute the program.

# Source Files/Implementation
If you are interested in the source code of the compiler, please send a request to sowadkhan912@gmail.com and specify the purpose. I am not able to make the code publicly available as the compiler was a school project, and future terms may do the same thing.

# How to program in WLP4
- Visit the links above to understand how WLP4 works
- Create a wlp4 program (some example files are in this repository)
- Download all the files and run in a Linux environment. To compile, run the ```.sh``` bash file, which will generate an assembly program. Once again, to access these files, please contact me. With this assembly file, we can generate mips machine code with the proper linked files, and then run this machine code to run the WLP4 code.
